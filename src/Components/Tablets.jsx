      <h1>Important Tablets/Supplements During Pregnancy</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Folic Acid</h3>
          <p>
            Folic acid is crucial for the proper development of the baby's brain and spinal cord. It helps prevent major birth defects, such as neural tube defects (NTDs), including spina bifida and anencephaly, which can affect the spinal cord and brain. Folic acid is most important during the first trimester of pregnancy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Benefits:</strong> Reduces the risk of birth defects, promotes healthy fetal development, and supports maternal health.
          </p>
          <p>Recommended Dosage: 400-800 mcg per day before conception and during early pregnancy (first 12 weeks).</p>
          <p>
            It's advisable to start folic acid supplementation at least one month before conception to ensure its effect during early fetal development.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Iron</h3>
          <p>
            Iron is an essential mineral that helps in the formation of hemoglobin in red blood cells. It is crucial for preventing anemia during pregnancy, a condition that can lead to fatigue, weakness, and complications for both mother and baby. Pregnancy increases the demand for iron as the body has to supply oxygen to the growing baby.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Benefits:</strong> Prevents iron-deficiency anemia, improves oxygen transport, supports healthy growth of the baby, and helps maintain healthy energy levels.
          </p>
          <p>Recommended Dosage: 27 mg per day (this is typically higher than the recommended daily iron intake for non-pregnant women).</p>
          <p>
            Iron supplements are best taken with vitamin C to increase absorption. Avoid taking iron with calcium-rich foods or drinks, as calcium can interfere with iron absorption.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Calcium</h3>
          <p>
            Calcium is essential for the development of the baby's bones, teeth, muscles, heart, and nerves. It also helps the mother maintain healthy bone density. If the mother doesn’t get enough calcium, her body will draw from her bones, which could lead to bone loss over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Benefits:</strong> Supports the development of the baby's skeletal system, helps maintain maternal bone strength, and ensures healthy nerve and muscle function.
          </p>
          <p>Recommended Dosage: 1,000 mg per day for pregnant women aged 19-50 years. Women under 18 years may need 1,300 mg per day.</p>
          <p>
            You can get calcium from dairy products, fortified foods, and leafy greens. If you’re not able to get enough calcium from food, a supplement may be necessary.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Vitamin D</h3>
          <p>
            Vitamin D plays a critical role in helping the body absorb calcium and phosphorus, both of which are necessary for strong bones and teeth. During pregnancy, vitamin D helps to ensure that the developing baby’s bones, teeth, and overall development are properly supported.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Benefits:</strong> Enhances calcium absorption, supports healthy bone development, promotes immune function, and may reduce the risk of complications such as preeclampsia.
          </p>
          <p>Recommended Dosage: 600 IU per day during pregnancy.</p>
          <p>
            Vitamin D is produced by the body when the skin is exposed to sunlight, but many women may need supplementation, especially if they have limited sun exposure or live in areas with little sunlight.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Omega-3 Fatty Acids (DHA)</h3>
          <p>
            Omega-3 fatty acids, specifically docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are essential for the development of the baby's brain, eyes, and nervous system. DHA helps form the brain's structure and function and is critical for cognitive development.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Benefits:</strong> Supports brain and eye development in the baby, helps reduce the risk of premature birth, and supports maternal heart health.
          </p>
          <p>Recommended Dosage: 200-300 mg of DHA per day.</p>
          <p>
            DHA is found in fatty fish like salmon, but if you're vegetarian or vegan, you can take algae-based supplements that provide DHA.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Vitamin B6</h3>
          <p>
            Vitamin B6 plays a key role in brain development and the production of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine. It also helps with the metabolism of proteins and red blood cells. During pregnancy, vitamin B6 is known to help alleviate symptoms of morning sickness.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Benefits:</strong> Supports the production of red blood cells, reduces nausea and vomiting, helps in the metabolism of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.
          </p>
          <p>Recommended Dosage: 10-25 mg per day during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester to combat nausea.</p>
          <p>
            Vitamin B6 is found in foods like chicken, potatoes, bananas, and fortified cereals. If needed, supplements can be used.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Magnesium</h3>
          <p>
            Magnesium plays a role in over 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It supports muscle and nerve function, and is essential for the development of the baby’s bones and teeth. Magnesium can also help alleviate some pregnancy discomforts like leg cramps and prevent preterm labor.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Benefits:</strong> Helps in muscle function, prevents leg cramps, supports proper development of bones and teeth, regulates blood pressure, and may reduce the risk of premature birth.
          </p>
          <p>Recommended Dosage: 350-400 mg per day.</p>
          <p>
            Foods rich in magnesium include leafy greens, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. Magnesium supplements may be recommended if your intake from food is insufficient.
